# Air Particulate Sensor Code
Open sourced software for monitoring PM2.5 and PM10 Air Particulate

## Read Air Particulate Values with Code

`matter.py`

airPolution/matter.py contains the code for monitoring air particulate values.
When ran, the file measures an average level of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air over a minute, in 15 minute intervals (1 on, 14 off) and writes these values to a **data.txt** file in the same directory.

```python
Future: add <matter.py>
```
